How to install?

1. Copy the Spirit Launcher folder to your BDO folder
Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Black Desert Online\Spirit Launcher

2. Create a shortcut
Right click Spirit Launcher.exe -> Send to -> Desktop

3. That's it. Launch it by using the shortcut


NOTE: If you've installed BDO in a primary partition(like C), you'll need to run the launcher as an administrator:
Right click on the shortcut -> Run as administrator

Or set it to run as administrator permanently:
Right click on the shortcut -> Properties -> Advanced -> Tick Run as administrator box
